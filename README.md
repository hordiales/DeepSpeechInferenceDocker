Project [DeepSpeech](https://github.com/mozilla/DeepSpeech]DeepSpeech) is an open source Speech-To-Text engine, using a model trained by machine learning techniques, based on Baidu's Deep Speech research paper. Project DeepSpeech uses Google's TensorFlow project to make the implementation easier.

This is a dockerfile to run inference with the pre-trained english model.

	Tested with DeepSpeech version: 0.2.0a8

# Usage

#### Build the image

Available pre-trained English model is about 2.1 GB, get patient. Uncomment wget line in Dockerfile or download it by hand.

	$ wget -O - https://github.com/mozilla/DeepSpeech/releases/download/v0.2.0/deepspeech-0.2.0-models.tar.gz | tar xvfz -

Docker image build

	$ docker build -t deepspeech-inference .

#### Create a compatible wav file

Currently only WAVE files with 16-bit, 16 kHz, mono are supported in the Python client)

	$ ffmpeg -i INPUT_AUDIO_FILE -ar 16000 -af aformat=s16:16000 -ac 1 audio_16k.wav

#### Run the inference from command line

Process input_audio_16k.wav and throws the text output to console

	$ docker run -it --rm -v /your/path/models:/models -v /your/path/audio/input_audio_16k.wav:/audio.wav deepspeech-inference

Note: with the pre-trained model embedded in the docker image, run it without '-v /your/path/models:/models'
